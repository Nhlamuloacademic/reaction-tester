# reaction-tester
This is a web based game project developed using HTML, CSS and a bit of Javascript. 
So when a user clicks on the shapes that appear randomly which can either be a square or a circle,
the program calculates the reaction time(time taken) it took for the user to click on either shape which also highlights colors randomly.
